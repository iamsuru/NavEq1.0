NavEq is an abbreviation of Navigation and Enquiry.

NavEq, my minor project, is a purposeful fusion of navigation and inquiry systems tailored to address the needs of unfamiliar visitors at SRIT (my college). This innovative project aims to facilitate seamless navigation within the college premises, catering to users who may be unfamiliar with the layout. By utilizing current and destination location information, NavEq assists users in efficiently navigating through the campus, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

Moreover, NavEq extends its functionality to incorporate an Inquiry System, featuring a responsive bot capable of providing answers to specific queries. This component of the project serves as a valuable resource for users seeking information within the college ecosystem. Whether it's about academic services, facilities, or any other pertinent details, the Enquiry System within NavEq acts as an intelligent assistant, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

In summary, NavEq stands out as a multifaceted solution, blending navigation assistance with an inquiry system, to enhance the overall experience of visitors within the SRIT campus.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
